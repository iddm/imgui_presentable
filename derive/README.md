# Imgui Presentable derive macro

This crate is a derive macro implementation to simplify the use of the immediate gui frameworks. Just derive the `ImguiPresentation` for the structs or enums and the magic will happen.

Please refer to the [crate documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/imgui_presentable/latest) and the
[main README](https://github.com/vityafx/imgui_presentable/blob/master/README.md)
file of the repository.
